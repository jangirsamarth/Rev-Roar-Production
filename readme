Sure! Below is a README file template that you can use for your project. It covers both the front-end and back-end parts of your website.

# Rev & Roar Website

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the **Rev & Roar** platform, which is a real estate and adventure travel platform. It has two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: Built with React.js and TailwindCSS for UI.
2. **Backend**: Built with Express.js, Node.js, and Google Sheets API for managing data.

This platform allows users to explore various destinations and itineraries for Himalayan adventures, sign up for tours, and submit contact information via forms. The backend stores submitted forms into a Google Spreadsheet.

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the frontend application, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jangirsamarth/rev-roar.git
cd rev-roar
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the website at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` folder.

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Google Cloud API credentials (for Google Sheets integration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository for the backend:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jangirsamarth/rev-roar-backend.git
cd rev-roar-backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables for Google Sheets API. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend folder and add the following:

```bash
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_google_private_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_google_client_email
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_google_spreadsheet_id
```

- **GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY**: This is the private key from your Google Cloud project (replace `\n` with actual new lines).
- **GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL**: This is the client email from your Google Cloud project.
- **GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID**: This is the ID of the Google Spreadsheet where form submissions are stored.

### Running the Backend Server

To start the backend server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on port `5000` (or another port defined in `.env`).

### Deploying the Backend

You can deploy the backend on Vercel or another hosting platform. Follow the instructions on the platform's website for setting up a Node.js app.

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend can be deployed on Vercel. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/).
2. Create a new project and link your GitHub repository.
3. Vercel will automatically detect your frontend app and build it.
4. After the deployment is complete, you will get a public URL to access your app.

### Backend Deployment

You can deploy the backend on platforms such as Heroku, Vercel, or DigitalOcean. Hereâ€™s an example for deploying on Vercel:

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/).
2. Create a new project and link your backend GitHub repository.
3. Set the environment variables as per your `.env` file on Vercel.
4. Deploy the app and access the public URL.
